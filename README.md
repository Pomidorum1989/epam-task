## Problem 1: Random Number Array Manipulation

### Description
Generate an array of 10 random integers between 0 and 9. Find the largest number in the array, remove it, and store it in another array. Continue this process until the original array has fewer than 8 elements. Finally, multiply all the numbers in the second array and output the result.

## Problem 2: Calculate Elapsed Seconds of the Day

### Description
Write a function that calculates the number of seconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the current day. Return the result in seconds and print it to the console.

## Problem 3: Sort Object Properties by Values

### Description
Write a program that sorts the properties of an object based on their values in ascending order and prints the sorted property names to the console.
